# 👋 Hi there, I'm Kaung Min Khant

I'm a Robotics Engineer with a passion for intelligent automation, computer vision, and AI-driven systems. I graduated with **First Class Honours in BEng (Hons) Robotics Engineering** from the **University of the West of England (UWE)**.

My work bridges **robotics**, **embedded development**, and **machine learning** — building systems that sense, learn, and act in real-time.
